# pojshop
This is a website I've created. It's a fictional (ficticious?) shop.

I am trying to learn about web development, and after completing an online course (Udacity's Web Development. https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253) that uses Python and the webapp2 framework, I decided to learn about Django. I worked through the tutorial section in the Django documentation, and I worked through How To Tango With Django (http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/index.html) Since I can now tango (with Django) I thought it would be a good idea to try to commit to a project.

My goals were to gain experience in working on a large project, at least, a project larger and more complex than a single-page/standalone-problem tasks. I also wanted to see a project through to publishing. This website is still a work-in-progress, but it has a set of complementing features, and I've learned about Django deployment on to a webserver.

Like I said, it's not a finished project, and indeed, the bulk of the project is in the control panel/CMS thing which is not visible to anyone without a staff account. But the site is live at http://poj.ianb.net/
